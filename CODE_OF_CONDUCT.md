# The Covenant of the Assembly Before the Lord

## Our Oath Before God
We, the members, laborers, and overseers of this congregation, do swear by the name of the Lord to make this fellowship a sanctuary of peace, for “ye shall not respect persons in judgment; but ye shall hear the small as well as the great; ye shall not be afraid of the face of man; for the judgment is God’s” (Deuteronomy 1:17, KJV). No distinction shall be made among us by age, stature, infirmity seen or unseen, tribe, seed, garb, wealth, land, countenance, altar, or ways of the flesh, for all stand equal before the Lord.

We vow to walk in the way of the Lord, for “thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself” (Leviticus 19:18, KJV), that this assembly may be a light unto all who enter.

## The Statutes of Our Conduct
These are the ways that honor the Lord and strengthen this congregation:

- “Thou shalt open thine hand wide unto thy brother, to thy poor, and to thy needy, in thy land” (Deuteronomy 15:11, KJV), showing mercy and kindness,
- “Keep thy tongue from evil, and thy lips from speaking guile” (Psalm 34:13, KJV), honoring the voices that differ,
- “Thou shalt in any wise rebuke thy neighbour, and not suffer sin upon him” (Leviticus 19:17, KJV), giving and receiving counsel with grace,
- “If thou shalt confess with thy mouth…and shalt believe in thine heart” (cf. Deuteronomy 30:14, KJV), owning thy faults and making amends unto those thou hast wronged,
- “Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thine heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy might” (Deuteronomy 6:5, KJV), seeking the good of all the camp.

These are the deeds thou shalt not do:

- “Thou shalt not commit adultery” (Exodus 20:14, KJV), nor speak words of harlotry nor show images thereof,
- “Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbour” (Exodus 20:16, KJV), nor scoff, curse, nor revile thy brother,
- “Thou shalt not go up and down as a talebearer among thy people” (Leviticus 19:16, KJV), nor pursue thy neighbor with malice,
- “Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy brother” (cf. Leviticus 18:7, KJV), nor reveal his hidden things without his blessing,
- “Thou shalt not do so unto the Lord thy God: for every abomination to the Lord, which he hateth, have they done” (Deuteronomy 12:31, KJV), nor act in ways unbefitting the holy.

## The Duty of the Overseers
The overseers of this flock shall “judge the people with just judgment” (Deuteronomy 16:18, KJV), making plain these statutes and purging the evil from among us. They shall cast aside any word, work, or offering that defies this covenant, and “they shall teach my people the difference between the holy and profane, and cause them to discern between the unclean and the clean” (Ezekiel 44:23, KJV).

## The Reach of This Covenant
This law shall govern all the tents of this assembly, and wheresoever a man bears our name in the gates, for “ye shall be unto me a kingdom of priests, and an holy nation” (Exodus 19:6, KJV).

## The Cry for Justice
If any man behold transgression, let him cry unto the overseers at the project's e-mail address, for “if thou afflict them in any wise, and they cry at all unto me, I will surely hear their cry” (Exodus 22:23, KJV). Every plea shall be weighed with haste and equity, and the overseers shall “not wrest judgment; thou shalt not respect persons, neither take a gift: for a gift doth blind the eyes of the wise” (Deuteronomy 16:19, KJV).

## The Judgments of Transgression
The overseers shall wield these decrees to “put away the evil from among you” (Deuteronomy 17:7, KJV):

1. **Reproof**  
   *Sin:* Words or deeds unclean in the sight of the Lord.  
   *Judgment:* A warning in secret, for “thou shalt in any wise rebuke thy neighbour, and not suffer sin upon him” (Leviticus 19:17, KJV), and perchance a call to “make an atonement for him” (Numbers 5:8, KJV).

2. **Admonition**  
   *Sin:* A breach of this covenant, whether once or oft-repeated.  
   *Judgment:* A stern warning, with silence imposed, for “he that hateth reproof shall die” (Proverbs 15:10, KJV), and further trespass may lead to banishment.

3. **Banishment for a Season**  
   *Sin:* A grievous sin or a stubborn heart.  
   *Judgment:* A casting out for a time, for “that soul shall utterly be cut off; his iniquity shall be upon him” (Numbers 15:31, KJV), until repentance be shown.

4. **Cutting Off Forever**  
   *Sin:* A pattern of rebellion, oppression, or despising of the flock.  
   *Judgment:* A final severance, for “the Lord will not spare him, but then the anger of the Lord and his jealousy shall smoke against that man” (Deuteronomy 29:20, KJV).
